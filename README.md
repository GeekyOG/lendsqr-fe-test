# Getting Started with Create React App

# run npm i to install packages

# run npm start to get app started

Users data are stored on localstarage on first run on the app

Since a mobile a design was not provided I was taked to using my own discretion in doing so.

No specification for authentication was stated therefore, you can simply access users page by clicking th Log in button.

The status of a user was not returned from the api so I returned active for all users.
